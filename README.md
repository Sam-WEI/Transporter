# Transporter

__A simple Java game. __

Player is required to transport the four cargo on the surface of the planet to the Space Station running over the planet. The time is limited since that once the Space Station is going out of sight, player has no idea where to transport the cargo.

Player has to control the thrusters well with arrow keys, either to remain a relative rest to the Space Station when entering the unloading zone at the butt of the Space Station, or to land __softly__ and __firmly__ onto the platform in order to load the remaining cargo. If the rocket-like aircraft hits the ground, or hits the Space Station body, or hits the platform hard, it will burst up.
